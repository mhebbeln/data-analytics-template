A short description of the project, including its purpose and main features.

---

This project is organized into the following folders:

- **Assets**: Contains supplementary materials such as articles, tutorials, or references that support the project's development.
- **Code**: Includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for data analysis and processing.
  - **Notebooks**: Python Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) used for analysis.
  - **Scripts**: Python scripts (.py) for automation and processing.
- **Data**: Organized into subfolders for streamlined data management:
  - **Data Sources**: Raw datasets sourced for the project.
  - **Raw**: Original, unprocessed data.
  - **In Process**: Data currently being cleaned or transformed.
  - **Final**: Fully processed and cleaned data ready for analysis.
- **Finished Product**: Contains the final outputs and deliverables, such as visualizations, reports, or summarized datasets.

Each folder contains a `README.md` file with further details about its purpose and contents.

   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd [project_directory]
     ```
   - Run the following command to install project dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Project**

   - Start the project by running the appropriate command:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

6. **Access the Project**
   - Open a web browser or the appropriate client to access the project.
